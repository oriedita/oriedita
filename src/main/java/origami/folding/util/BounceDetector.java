/**
 * Author: Mu-Tsun Tsai
 * 
 * The original Orihime algorithm chooses an initial SubFace ordering to perform
 * the exhaustive search, but it is very commonly the case that the ordering is
 * not optimal, leading to a phenomenon I called "bouncing", where the search
 * hits a dead-end at a certain depth (H) and have to return to another certain
 * depth (L) repeatedly. This suggests that SubFace H is more "relevant" to
 * those SubFaces before L, so swapping H and L typically leads to a much faster
 * search.
 * 
 * This BounceDetector class detects the bouncing phenomenon based on some
 * sensitivity constants and makes the swap when it detects one. A direct
 * swapping turns out to be the best; I've tried rotation but it's not really
 * helping.
 * 
 * Although this technique in general greatly shortens the runtime for any
 * model, in some cases it takes a while to detect some less obvious or deeply
 * buried bouncing. To improve those will take a greater understanding of the
 * Orihime algorithm.
